## About Me

Android & Web Developer from India, focused on **building practical products** and
improving through **consistent execution**.

I prefer working on real projects over chasing trends or titles.
Currently developing **BlizX**, while sharpening fundamentals across mobile and web.

I value:
- Clean, readable code
- Long-term skill compounding
- Depth over noise

### For Recruiters
- Role focus: Android / Web Development
- Strengths: problem-solving, implementation, consistency
- Comfortable with modern tooling and learning on the job
- Looking for environments that value 

### For Founders
I’m interested in building things that actually get used.

I care about:
- Shipping usable features
- Iterating fast with feedback
- Improving systems, not just code

If you value builders over talkers, we’ll get along.
